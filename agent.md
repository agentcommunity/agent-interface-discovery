# Agent Interface Discovery (AID) - Agent Context

## 🎯 Project Overview

**AID** is a minimal, DNS-only agent discovery standard that answers: *"Given a domain name, where is its AI agent?"* It uses a single DNS TXT record to make any agent service instantly discoverable, eliminating manual configuration and API documentation hunting.

### Core Mission
- **Decentralized**: No central registry - if you control a domain, you can publish an AID record
- **Protocol-Agnostic**: Works with MCP, A2A, OpenAPI, or custom protocols
- **Zero-Configuration**: Users type a domain and automatically connect to its agent
- **Production-Ready**: Built for enterprise adoption with comprehensive security and reliability

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Contract-First Development**: `protocol/constants.yml` is the single source of truth
2. **Language Idiomatic**: Each implementation uses language-specific best practices
3. **Cross-Language Parity**: All implementations must pass identical test suites
4. **Security-First**: Comprehensive validation, HTTPS enforcement, DNSSEC support
5. **Production-Grade CI/CD**: Automated releases, security scanning, comprehensive testing

## 📊 Current Development Status

### ✅ Completed Phases

**Phase 0: Foundation** - Monorepo setup, tooling, and development environment
**Phase 1: Core Libraries** - TypeScript implementation with full spec compliance
**Phase 2: Multi-Language Support** - Python, Go implementations with live DNS testing
**Phase 3: Web Workbench** - Interactive discovery and generation interface

### 🚧 Current Work (feat/optimize_workbench)
- Optimizing workbench components for better performance
- Documentation updates and specification refinements
- Preparing for Phase 4: Enhanced features and ecosystem expansion

### 🎯 Development Roadmap

**Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Enhanced workbench features
- Additional language implementations (Rust, .NET, Java)
- Community tooling and integrations

**Phase 5: Enterprise Adoption**
- Advanced security features
- Performance optimizations
- Enterprise integrations

## 🔧 Key Components & Responsibilities

### Core Libraries
- **`@agentcommunity/aid`**: TypeScript/Node.js implementation with browser support
- **`aid-doctor`**: CLI tool for validation and generation
- **Language SDKs**: Idiomatic implementations in Python, Go, Rust, .NET, Java

### Web Application (`packages/web/`)
- **Landing Page**: Marketing and documentation hub
- **Interactive Workbench**: Chat-style interface for DNS discovery testing
- **TXT Record Generator**: Form-based AID record creation with live validation
- **API Endpoints**: Server-side handshake testing with security safeguards

### Development Infrastructure
- **Turbo Monorepo**: Intelligent build orchestration and caching
- **PNPM Workspaces**: Efficient package management
- **Comprehensive CI/CD**: Multi-language testing, security scanning, automated releases
- **Live DNS Testing**: End-to-end validation against real domains

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development servers
pnpm dev              # All packages in watch mode
pnpm dev:core         # Just core libraries
pnpm dev:web          # Web application only

# Quality checks
pnpm lint             # Code style and type checking
pnpm test             # Full test suite across all languages
pnpm build            # Production builds with caching

# Protocol updates
pnpm gen              # Regenerate constants from YAML
```

### Code Quality Standards
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any`, exact optional properties, comprehensive type coverage
- **Cross-Language Parity**: Identical behavior across all implementations
- **Security-First**: Input validation, HTTPS enforcement, SSRF protection
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization, intelligent caching, minimal dependencies

### Release Process
1. **Changesets**: Semantic versioning with automated changelog generation
2. **CI Validation**: All tests pass, security scans clean, build successful
3. **Automated Publishing**: NPM, PyPI, Go modules published simultaneously
4. **Documentation**: Updated specs and examples with each release

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### User Experience
- **Zero Friction**: Type domain → discover agent → connect
- **Educational**: Workbench shows actual DNS queries and protocol handshakes
- **Professional**: Modern chat interface matching contemporary AI tools

### Developer Experience
- **Predictable**: Consistent commands and workflows across packages
- **Fast**: Intelligent caching, hot reloading, parallel execution
- **Reliable**: Comprehensive testing, type safety, automated quality checks

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data clearly separated
- **Reusability**: Core logic extracted into shareable packages
- **Maintainability**: Clear patterns, comprehensive documentation, automated tooling

## 🔒 Security & Reliability
