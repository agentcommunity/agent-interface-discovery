# Agent Report — chore/terraform-showcase

## Summary

- Emphasized canonical base `_agent.<domain>` TXT records in `showcase/terraform/main.tf`.
- Added `record_ttl` variable (default 360) with guidance to use 300–900 seconds per spec §4.
- Added optional protocol-specific examples (underscore form) gated behind `include_protocol_specific=false` by default, with clear “optional” notes.
- Added `showcase/terraform/README.md` with usage (init/plan only), canonical/optional notes, TTL guidance, and safety notes (no secrets, no apply).
- No Changeset added (examples only; no user-facing packages or docs published).

## Files changed

- Modified: `showcase/terraform/main.tf`
  - Introduced variables: `record_ttl` (number, default 360), `include_protocol_specific` (bool, default false).
  - Refactored locals into `base_records` (canonical) and `protocol_specific_records` (optional underscore form), and merged via conditional.
  - Wired `ttl = var.record_ttl` in `vercel_dns_record` resource.
  - Normalized `proto` usage to alias `p` consistently to match examples in spec.
- Added: `showcase/terraform/README.md`
  - Instructions for `terraform fmt -check`, `init`, `validate`, `plan`; no `apply`.
  - Canonical record emphasis; protocol-specific subdomains optional; TTL guidance; safety notes.

## Commands run

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm -w build`
- `pnpm -w test` (note: Python tests failed due to missing pytest in the environment; unrelated to this change)
- `pnpm -w lint`
- `terraform fmt -check` (Terraform CLI not installed in env; formatting check not executed)

## Build/Test/Lint results

- Build: PASS (workspace build succeeded)
- Lint: PASS (no ESLint warnings or errors in JS/TS packages)
- Tests: PARTIAL
  - JS/TS and Go runners passed.
  - Python runner failed: `/usr/bin/python3: No module named pytest` (environment issue; not related to Terraform showcase changes).
- Terraform fmt: NOT RUN (Terraform binary unavailable in this environment)

## Next steps

- Optional: Install Terraform locally to run `terraform fmt -check` and `terraform validate` in CI for this folder.
- If desired, add a CI job to ensure `showcase/terraform` stays formatted and validates without applying.
- Consider adding example variables file for quick planning (no secrets).

## Branch

- `chore/terraform-showcase`
