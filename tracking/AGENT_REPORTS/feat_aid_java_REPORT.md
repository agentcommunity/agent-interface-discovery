# Agent 4: Java (aid-java)

- Branch: `feat/aid-java`
- Goal: Java library (Gradle) with parser + generated constants + tests; no DNS discovery.

## Implemented

- Project scaffold under `packages/aid-java` with Gradle Java 11 library and JUnit 5 tests
- `Constants.java` generated by `pnpm gen` (generator updated to include `LOCAL_URI_SCHEMES`)
- Parser `Parser.parse(String)` with validation matching spec and TS reference
- `AidError` extending `RuntimeException` with `code` and `errorCode`
- `AidRecord` POJO
- Parity tests loading `test-fixtures/golden.json` and exercising error mapping
- README with usage and developer commands

## Verification

- `pnpm gen` writes `Constants.java` with spec version, tokens, error codes, DNS constants, and local URI schemes
- `./gradlew :aid-java:build :aid-java:test` runs green

## Notes

- No external runtime deps added; tests avoid JSON libraries by using a minimal parser for `golden.json`
