Below is a **slow-step, no-surprises checklist** for a staged v1.0.0 release.

---

## Staged Release Plan: npm First, PyPI After Approval

**Constraint:** The `agent-community` project name on PyPI is pending approval. We cannot publish the Python package yet.

**Plan:**

1. **Phase 1:** Prepare everything, run the v1.0.0 Changeset, and publish all **npm packages**.
2. **Phase 2:** Once the PyPI project is approved, publish the already-versioned **Python package**.

---

## 0 . 5-second refresher: what the tokens are

| Token                             | What it’s for                                                                            | Where to create it                                                                | Where to store it                       |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **`NPM_TOKEN`**                   | Lets the GitHub Action run `npm publish` on your behalf.                                 | npmjs.com → _Access Tokens_ → _Automation_                                        | GitHub → _Settings → Secrets → Actions_ |
| **`PYPI_TOKEN` (DEFERRED)**       | Lets the Action upload wheels/sdists to PyPI with `twine upload`. **Set up in Phase 2.** | pypi.org → _Account Settings_ → _API tokens_                                      | Same GitHub Secrets panel               |
| _(optional)_ **`GH_RELEASE_PAT`** | Only if you want the Action to draft GitHub releases automatically.                      | GitHub → _Developer settings → Personal access tokens (classic)_ (scopes: `repo`) | GitHub Secrets                          |

- [x] NPM_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] PYPI_TOKEN (deferred)
- [x] GH_RELEASE_PAT (in progress)

---

## 1 . License & metadata sanity

_This is now complete for all packages, including Python._

- [x] **One root `LICENSE` file** (MIT)
  - [x] _Copied into each public package’s `files` array._
- [x] **`license` field** in _every_ `package.json` – matches the root license.
- [x] **`author` / `repository` fields** present for OSS optics.
- [x] Private packages set `"private": true` **and** `publishConfig.access: "restricted"`.
- [x] Public packages set `publishConfig.access: "public"` (needed for scoped packages).

---

## 2 . Version baseline

- [x] All publishable packages (JS and Python) are **≤ 0.1.x** right now.
- [ ] **Important:** The Changeset workflow will bump **all** public packages to 1.0.0 in one go. We will configure the workflow to _only publish the npm packages_ for now. This keeps our versions in sync.
- [x] Internal/private packages can stay at 0.0.0; Changesets will ignore them (they’re in `ignore` list).

---

## 3 . Registry access

### **Phase 1: npm (Done)**

- [x] `npm login` locally → verify you’re in the **@agentcommunity** org.
- [x] `npm whoami` – sanity check user.
- [x] Create **Automation token** (done, see above).
- [x] Put it in GH Secrets as **`NPM_TOKEN`**.

### **Phase 2: PyPI (Deferred)**

- [ ] Once the `agent-community` project is approved, create it on PyPI.
- [ ] In PyPI Settings → API tokens → **Add** a token scoped to the project.
- [ ] Copy the token to GH Secrets as **`PYPI_TOKEN`**.
- [ ] Un-comment the Python publish step in the release workflow.

---

## 4 . GitHub Actions files

- [x] The release workflow contains a `changeset publish` step with `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}` env set.
- [x] **The Python publish job/step is temporarily disabled.**
- [x] Matrix builds pass under `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- [x] Workflow that builds `packages/web` uses **Node 20** (Next 14’s recommend).

---

## 5 . npm package contents

For every public **npm** package:

- [x] `files` array or `.npmignore` excludes `/src`, tests, storybook assets, etc.
- [x] Bundle size under control (`npm pack --dry-run` shows only `dist/**`, `README`, `LICENSE`).
- [x] CLI packages have correct shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) and `bin` field.

---

Below is a **branch-based, protected-main, staged-publish release checklist** that reflects the new reality:

- **`aid-web-generator` folded into `aid-doctor`**
- **main is protected — no direct pushes**
- **npm first, PyPI later**
- **dry-run pack command clarified**

---

FIANL STEPS:

## 0 . Pre-flight matrix (unchanged)

- Tokens, licences, ignore list, etc. already ticked — see previous checklist.

---

## 1 . Create the release branch (`release/v1.0.0`)

```bash
git switch -c release/v1.0.0 origin/main
pnpm clean && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && pnpm test
```

_Everything must pass before you touch Changesets._

---

## 2 . Generate the single **major** Changeset

(affects every public npm package, including the new code in `aid-doctor`, but _ignores_ web / e2e / runners)

```bash
pnpm changeset add
# choose "major" → summary: "Initial stable release. Web generator merged into aid-doctor."
```

Commit the Changeset file:

```bash
git add .changeset
git commit -m "chore: create v1.0.0 changeset"
git push -u origin release/v1.0.0
```

---

## 3 . Open PR → **release/v1.0.0 → main**

- CI must be green (build / test / audit).
- Reviewers approve; but **do not squash-merge** (Changesets needs full commit).

---

## 4 . Merge PR — **main** now contains only the `.changeset/` entry

GitHub Actions does **nothing** yet (no version bump, no publish).

---

## 5 . Version & tag in _release branch_ (not on main)

We can’t push to main, so:

```bash
git switch release/v1.0.0   # already on this branch
git pull --ff-only origin main   # refresh with latest main

pnpm changeset version      # bumps every public pkg to 1.0.0, updates CHANGELOG
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): v1.0.0 version bump"
git push
```

CI runs again on the branch; should still be green.

---

## 6 . PR #2 → merge the **version bump commit** into main

- Title: “chore(release): publish v1.0.0”
- After merge, main now has the bump commit → triggers **Changesets GitHub Action** which:
  1. Builds
  2. Runs `pnpm changeset publish` (publishes **npm** packages only, because the Python step is disabled)

The action needs:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

_(already present)._

---

## 7 . Verify npm release

```bash
npm info @agentcommunity/aid version            # → 1.0.0
npm info @agentcommunity/aid-doctor version     # → 1.0.0
```

Local install smoke-test:

```bash
npm init -y tmp && cd tmp
npm install @agentcommunity/aid@1
npx aid-doctor --help
cd .. && rm -rf tmp
```

---

## 8 . Draft & publish GitHub Release notes

(Mark Python status as “coming soon after PyPI namespace approval.”)

---

## 9 . PyPI Publishing: OIDC Route (Currently Active)

**Status Update:** We've implemented PyPI publishing via **OIDC Pending Publisher** since the `agent-community` org approval is taking too long.

### Current Implementation (v1.0.0):

- ✅ PyPI publishing uses GitHub Actions OIDC (no secrets needed)
- ✅ Pending publisher configured for `aid-discovery` project
- ✅ Workflow updated with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`
- ✅ Python package published as `aid-discovery` v1.0.0

### How It Works:

1. Workflow has `permissions: { id-token: write, contents: read }`
2. PyPI pending publisher authenticates via OIDC
3. First publish creates the project automatically
4. No `PYPI_TOKEN` secret required

---

## 10 . Future Migration to Organization (After Approval)

**When the `agent-community` org is approved:**

1. **Transfer project ownership:**
   - PyPI → `aid-discovery` project → Settings → Transfer ownership → `agent-community`

2. **Optional: Switch to API token method:**
   - Generate project-scoped `PYPI_TOKEN` in the org account
   - Add to GitHub Secrets
   - Update workflow to use token instead of OIDC

3. **No version bumps needed** - just ownership transfer

### Legacy API Token Method (for reference):

```yaml
- name: Publish PyPI
  env:
    TWINE_USERNAME: '__token__'
    TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    cd packages/aid-py
    python -m build --sdist --wheel
    twine upload dist/*
```

---

## 11 . Fix for the dry-run command

Earlier failure came from filtering paths. Use workspace filter:

```bash
# Dry-run npm packs for every public JS package
pnpm -r --filter "@agentcommunity/*" --filter="!@agentcommunity/aid-py-test-runner" exec npm pack --dry-run
```

Or, simpler:

```bash
pnpm -r exec npm pack --dry-run
```

(Turbo/PNPM will still skip private packages listed with `"private": true` in `package.json`.)

---

## 12 . Update ignore list (aid-web-generator is gone)

`.changeset/config.json`

```json
"ignore": [
  "@agentcommunity/aid-web",
  "@agentcommunity/e2e-tests",
  "@agentcommunity/aid-go-test-runner",
  "@agentcommunity/aid-py-test-runner"
]
```

---

### Recap

**npm packages (completed):**

1. **release/v1.0.0 branch**: changeset add → PR #1
2. Merge PR #1 → main (only changeset entry)
3. Version bump on same branch → PR #2
4. Merge PR #2 → main → CI publishes npm 1.0.0

**Python package (current approach):**

1. **release/v1.0.0-python branch**: direct version bump + OIDC workflow
2. PR → main → merge → CI publishes `aid-discovery` v1.0.0 to PyPI via OIDC
3. Project ownership transfer to org when approved (no code changes needed)

Take it slow, tick each box, and you'll ship without tripping the protected-main rule or PyPI delay.
