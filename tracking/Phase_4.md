# PHASE 4 - Progress Log

## [2024-06-09] Web Workbench: Lint & TypeScript Cleanup Complete

- Fixed all remaining TypeScript and ESLint errors in the web workbench, including:
  - Removed unnecessary type assertions in `discovery-chat.tsx`
  - Removed unused imports in `use-chat-engine.ts`
  - Fixed all unescaped quotes in JSX content
  - Wrapped helper functions in `useCallback` to resolve React hook dependency warnings
- All linting and type checks now pass cleanly across the codebase
- Pushed changes to the `feat/web-fixes2` branch
- This completes the web workbench migration to a fully type-safe, lint-clean, and modern codebase

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Major Web Workbench Refactor

- Migrated all agent demo domains to new scenario-based manifest files in `packages/web/src/lib/scenarios/`.
- Replaced legacy tool manifest monolith with a simple scenario map; all mock/demo logic is now data-driven.
- Refactored chat engine to a reducer-based state machine with datasource injection (live vs. mock).
- UI now renders only user/assistant/tool_event messages; legacy tool_call and imperative script logic removed.
- All discovery and handshake logic now returns explicit Result<T, E> types for runtime safety.
- Ran `pnpm lint --fix` and began explicit-any cleanup; remaining linter errors are isolated to legacy or transitional code.
- System is now live-first, deterministic, and testable, with demo logic fully isolated from production code.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Phase 4: CI Hardening & DX Improvements

- **Updated `README.md`**: The root `README.md` now includes a dedicated "Updating Protocol Constants" section, instructing developers to use the `protocol/constants.yml` file and the `pnpm gen` command.
- **Verified CI Pipeline**: Confirmed that the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pipeline already enforces that any changes to `protocol/constants.yml` must be accompanied by committed generated code, failing the build if they are out of sync.
- **Audited Package READMEs**: Checked language-specific READMEs (`aid-py`) to ensure no outdated instructions on manual constant editing remained.
- **Prepared `.cursorrule` Update**: Specified the required changes for the project's `.cursorrule` to reflect `protocol/constants.yml` as the single source of truth and to update the "update constants" trigger.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Unified Constant Generation & Cross-Language Parity (Phase 2 & 3)

Successfully executed the plan for Phase 2 and 3, establishing a single source of truth for protocol constants and verifying that all three language implementations (TypeScript, Go, Python) are fully synchronized and passing tests.

### Phase 2: Generator Rewrite

- **Upgraded `scripts/generate-constants.ts`**: The script now reads from `protocol/constants.yml` and generates constant files for all three target languages.
- **Implemented Go Constant Generation**:
  - A new `generateGoConstants` function was added to the script.
  - It produces a new file, `packages/aid-go/constants_gen.go`, which is now the canonical source for Go constants.
  - **Critical Fix**: Corrected the generator to output `PascalCase` names for Go constants (e.g., `SpecVersion` instead of `spec_version`), making them exported and visible across the `aid` package. This was the root cause of the initial Go build failures.
- **Removed Legacy Code**: The old, manually-maintained `packages/aid-go/constants.go` was deleted to prevent conflicts.
- **Updated Go Source Files**: All files in `packages/aid-go/` (`parser.go`, `discover.go`, `error.go`) were updated to use the new, correctly-cased constants from `constants_gen.go`.

### Phase 3: Repo-Wide Validation

- **Synchronized Constants**: Ran `pnpm gen` to ensure all constant files were up-to-date from the YAML source.
- **Fixed and Verified Test Suite**: The main `pnpm test` command was failing for both Go and Python. The following fixes were implemented:
  - **Go**: The build and test failures were resolved by the `PascalCase` generator fix from Phase 2. The tests in `packages/aid-go/` now pass correctly.
  - **Python**: Addressed a `pytest: command not found` error within the `pnpm`/`turbo` execution environment. The fix involved two steps in `packages/aid-py/package.json`:
    1. Separated dependency installation into its own `install-dev` script: `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
    2. Changed the `test` script to the more robust `python3 -m pytest`.
- **Achieved Full Parity**: After the fixes, the entire test suite now runs successfully, confirming that the TypeScript, Python, and Go implementations are aligned and behave identically as per the parity tests.

TODO:

PHASE 5 — Cleanup & Future-proofing

1. **Remove spec parsing code** in generator (we now rely solely on YAML).
2. **Add `scripts/check-spec-sync.ts`** (optional)  
   • Parse `specification.md` tables (using `marked`)  
   • Compare to YAML; CI warns if docs drift.

3. **Onboard new language in future**  
   • Add `<lang>Constants` generation function in the same script, point to new path.

With this sequence everything compiles at each step, CI never turns red, and the repo ends with a single YAML source feeding every SDK plus a doc-drift guard.
