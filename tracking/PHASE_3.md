## Phase 3.1: Enhancements ‚Äî ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

This phase brought the workbench from polished demo to production-ready reliability by addressing all critical failure paths.

### **[2025-07-07 14:00]** Advanced Error Handling & Real-World Scenarios

- **Engine Enhancement:** `useChatEngine` now validates domain input, continues execution after tool failure, and uses per-call mock data, ensuring predictable demos and robust flows.
- **Granular Backend Errors:** `/api/discover` returns spec-aligned `AidError` codes plus numeric constants.
- **New 'Live Domain' Flow:** Introduced `live-unsupported` manifest that performs real discovery and gracefully informs users that live handshakes are disabled.
- **Intelligent Narratives:** All manifests now branch on success vs. failure, providing helpful context instead of silent errors.
- **Outcome:** Users get clear feedback for invalid input, discovery failures, connection failures, and unsupported live handshakes.

### **[2025-07-07 15:30]** Landing Page Mobile UX Polish

- Fixed QuickStart tabs layout for mobile (2√ó2 grid, compact icons, no text overflow).
- Improved code block responsiveness: smaller fonts, proper wrapping, and mobile-friendly padding.
- Added mobile-specific utilities (`.responsive-text-*`, updated `.code-block` & `.code-text`) in `globals.css`.
- Ensured grid layouts stack gracefully on small screens across all sections.
- **Outcome:** Landing page is now fully usable and visually polished on phones and tablets.

### **[2025-07-07 16:00]** Live Handshake Capability shipped to production ‚Äì `/api/handshake` proxy with MCP SDK (WS + HTTP), SSRF guard, rate-limiting. Workbench now performs real initialization for Supabase/Auth0 domains. Phase 2 checklist fully green.

### **[2025-01-07 16:30]** Mode Switch ‚Äì Resolver ‚Üî Generator Implementation

- **Dual-Panel Architecture:** Added mode switcher with smooth slide animations between Resolver and Generator panels
- **Generator Panel v1:** Self-contained component for creating AID TXT records with live validation using core @agentcommunity/aid library
- **Spec-Compliant Form:** Only includes the 5 actual AID v1.0.0 fields (v, uri, proto, auth, desc) with proper validation
- **Real-Time Validation:** Uses core `parse()` function for 100% spec compatibility with live error feedback
- **Protocol/Auth Dropdowns:** Populated from PROTOCOL_TOKENS and AUTH_TOKENS constants with descriptive labels
- **Smart Validation:**
  - URI scheme validation (https:// for remote, docker:/npx:/pip: for local)
  - UTF-8 byte length checking for description field (60-byte limit)

### **[2025-01-07 17:00]** Hash-Based URL Routing for Direct Links

- **URL Routing Implementation:** Added hash-based routing so users can link directly to specific modes
- **URL Scheme:**
  - `/workbench` ‚Üí Resolver mode (default)
  - `/workbench#generator` ‚Üí Generator mode
- **Enhanced Navigation:** Updated header to include separate "Resolver" and "Generator" links with proper active state highlighting
- **Hash Change Listening:** Both workbench page and header listen for hash changes and update state accordingly
- **Clean URL Updates:** Mode switcher updates URL hash without page reload, maintaining browser history
- **TypeScript Build:** All changes compile cleanly with zero errors (build size: 33.8 kB workbench page)
- **Result:** Users can now bookmark and share direct links to either workbench mode
  - Protocol-specific validation using core library
- **Live Preview:** Real-time TXT record string generation with copy-to-clipboard and DNS record display
- **Visual Polish:** Two-column layout, validation status indicators, expandable parsed record view, DNS provider hints
- **Self-Contained Export:** GeneratorPanel can be reused in other pages/contexts as planned
- **Outcome:** Complete Resolver/Generator mode switching with production-ready TXT record generation capability

### **[2025-01-07 16:45]** UI Polish ‚Äì Eliminated Duplicate Titles

- **Problem Fix:** Removed confusing double-header issue (mode switcher title + panel titles)
- **Shared Component:** Created `TitleSection` component used by both Resolver and Generator panels
- **Clean Architecture:** Header now contains only mode toggle; consistent title positioning across modes
- **Design Consistency:** Both panels follow exact same layout patterns as finalized discovery-chat.tsx
- **TypeScript Quality:** All changes compile cleanly with zero errors or warnings
- **Result:** Professional, polished interface with no UI redundancy or confusion

**Next Steps:** Phase 4 planning and additional workbench enhancements as needed.

### ‚úÖ **Added Points in `PHASE_3.md`**

#### **\[2025-01-06 16:00] Web Package Setup**

- **Created:** `packages/web/` and **`packages/web-generator/`** directory structures
- **Configured:** TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Sonner, Framer Motion
- **Setup:** PostCSS, custom animations, responsive design system
- **Result:** Production-ready Next.js application foundation with a **reusable core generator library**

#### **\[2025-01-06 16:30] Core Infrastructure**

- **Built:** Utility functions (`cn()`, domain validation, time formatting) now fully linted and using modern best practices
- **Created:** Base UI components (Button, Input, Card, Badge) with **100% type safety and zero linting errors**
- **Implemented:** Layout components (Header with navigation, Footer with links)
- **Result:** Consistent design system and reusable components built on a clean, maintainable foundation

#### **\[2025-07-08] Codebase Refactoring & Hardening**

- **Architectural Refactor:** Extracted all UI-agnostic logic from the `GeneratorPanel` into a new, reusable monorepo package: **`@agentcommunity/aid-web-generator`**. This package can now be used by any application to build and validate AID records
- **Dependency Management:** Correctly configured `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` for the new `web-generator` package, establishing it as a formal workspace dependency for the `web` application using `pnpm`
- **Data/Logic Separation:** Decoupled the static `toolManifests` data from its presentation logic. The large array of manifest objects now lives in a dedicated `tool-manifest-data.ts` file, making it dramatically easier to add or edit demo scenarios without touching application code
- **Comprehensive Linting Cleanup:** Systematically resolved over 100 linting errors across the entire web application, including:
  - **Type Safety:** Eradicated all uses of `any` and `no-unsafe-*` errors by introducing strong types for API contracts, event handlers, and state management
  - **Promise Handling:** Fixed all `no-floating-promises` and `no-misused-promises` errors by correctly using `async/await`, `try/catch`, and the `void` operator for event handlers
  - **Modernization:** Replaced legacy patterns with modern JavaScript/TypeScript features like `replaceAll()` and nullish coalescing (`??`), and updated the `tsconfig.json` to target ES2021
  - **Code Style & Readability:** Eliminated all nested ternaries, unused variables, and magic numbers, replacing them with clear helper functions and named constants

- **Result:** A significantly more robust, maintainable, secure, and professional codebase. The application is now easier to scale, and the core generator logic is reusable
